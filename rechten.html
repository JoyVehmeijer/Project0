            Because I probably can't take a gap year due to Corona, I had to figure out what studies didn't have selections and might interest me.
            I had a pretty hard time with this, since all the studies, that I liked, did have a selection. That's why, when my father sugjested that
            I should study Law I was very surprised. I knew that was a study without a selection, but never really thought it would be a study for me.
            However, after hearing my father out, it was actually a pretty nice suggestion. If I would study Law and get accepted to Forensic Science next
            year, I could do both studies and get a degree for both. With those two studies, there could be a lot of job opportunities. That quite interested
            me, so I looked more into the different colleges where you can study Law. In the Netherlands, Leiden is know to be a very good place to study
            Law. Nevertheless, I saw that Law at the VU Amsterdam was ranked better. Below this, I am going to compare the both of them to figure
            out with one is better for me.<br><br>

            After doing the research and looking at the comparisons, I think I would like studying in Amsterdam more. It will also make it easier
            doing two studies at once, when I get to study Forensic Science as well next year.
