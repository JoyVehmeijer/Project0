            There are two studies related to computers, programming and such things that I am interested in, namely Artificial Intellegence and Computer Science and Engineering.
            I know a lot more about Computer Science and Engineering, since i have had my sights on that longer. I only really heard and starting thinking about Artificial Intellegence
            after a conversacion with a specialist who helps you decide what studies would suit you. He told me that, among other things, computer related studies would be very good
            for me and gave Computer Science and Engineering, Artificial Intellegence and Informatics as suggestions. Reading the description of Informatics I knew that wasn't really an
            option for me, but the other two definitely were.

          <h3> Artificial Intellegence </h3>
            <p id="Artificial">
            Artificial Intellegence is a study that is concerned with analyzing and describing human processes and tasks. As well as designing tools that can understand, support or
            execute these processes and tasks. It is something you see everywhere, think about searching with Google, recommendations on Netflix, self-driving cars, language recognition
            with Siri, spam filters and robots. So, It is a study where you need to be able to work with a computer and know how to program. Therefore, doing this course will come in hand
            of I do end up doing this study. This study is my plan C, meaning, if I don't get accepted to Forensic Science, I will still take a gap year if that is possible, but if that isn't
            possible, I will go and study Artificial Intellegence.
