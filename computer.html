            There are two studies related to computers, programming and such things that I am interested in, namely Artificial Intellegence and Computer Science and Engineering.
            I know a lot more about Computer Science and Engineering, since i have had my sights on that longer. I only really heard and starting thinking about Artificial Intellegence
            after a conversacion with a specialist who helps you decide what studies would suit you. He told me that, among other things, computer related studies would be very good
            for me and gave Computer Science and Engineering, Artificial Intellegence and Informatics as suggestions. Reading the description of Informatics I knew that wasn't really an
            option for me, but the other two definitely were.

            <h3> Artificial Intellegence </h3>
              <p id="Artificial">
            Artificial Intellegence is a study that is concerned with analyzing and describing human processes and tasks. As well as designing tools that can understand, support or
            execute these processes and tasks. It is something you see everywhere, think about searching with Google, recommendations on Netflix, self-driving cars, language recognition
            with Siri, spam filters and robots. So, it is a study where you need to be able to work with a computer and know how to program. Therefore, doing this course will come in hand
            of I do end up doing this study. This study is my plan C, meaning, if I don't get accepted to Forensic Science, I will still take a gap year if that is possible, but if that isn't
            possible, I will go and study Artificial Intellegence.

            <h3> Computer Science and Engineering </h3>
              <p id="Computer">
            Computer Science and Engineering is a study in Delft. I love Delft, it has the nicest vibes and looks like a smaller, cozier Amsterdam. I would love to study there, but won't for just the sity.
            I will also have to have a study that I liked if I would go study in Delft, but that speaks for itself. I went to an open day of Computer Science and Engineering and also had a spent a day with
            a student for the study to get a better feel of how the lectures are. Unfortunately, instead of liking the study even more, the girl I spent the day with scared me away a bit. She told me it
            was very important  to be very good at math, that it was very necesarry to have an 8 for Math B (in the Netherlands there are different levels of difficulty in Math) and also have Math D.
            With me, that wasn't the case. I am not bad but also not very good at Math. I have a 7 for Math B and don't have Math D. This made me think I wouldn't be good enougn in Math to do this study.
            Later, I heard for my mother that a daughter of a friend of hers is also studying Computer Science and Engineering or something similar and that she said that math isn't as important as I was
            told it was. Thus, the girl scared me away a little for the study without an actual good reason. Luckily, I heard it wasn't as bad as I thought and is the study still in the race for next year
            and am I going to look more into Computer Science and English, Industrial Design and Artificial Intellegence to see if I still want to have AI as a plan B next year or if one of the other studies
            interest me more as a plan B.
