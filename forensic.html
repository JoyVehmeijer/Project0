              Ever since I was a little girl, I have wanted to become a forensic scientist. It has been my dream for so long and I can't really see myself enjoying anything
              else in my life as much as i would enjoy Forensic Science. Personally, I like to study and job would suit me very well, because
              <ul>
                <li>I love solving puzzle and riddles, the harder the better!</li>
                <li>I love the series of CSI and often figure out who the killer is myself. </li>
                <li>I am a perfectionist and have a great eye for detial.</li>
                <li>I don't find things gross fast. </li>
                <li>I don't get scared easely. </li>
                <li>I work very organized and structured. </li>
              </ul><br>

              Forensic Science is a study where you learn how to collect effidence on a crime scene. When a crime has been committed, forensic scientist come the crime scene and collect fingerprints,
              make pictures of the scene and the evidence and collect traces of DNA. Later, they process everything in the lab to figure out who commited the crime. This has to be done very precize,
              so that the evidence doesn't tampered with and isn't valid anymore. This also clarifies the outfit a forensic scientist wairs at the crime scene. A white suit that covers their whole body,
              a haircap, gloves for the hands and gloves for the shoes and a face mask. All these things make sure no DNA, fingerprints or body fluids gets on the crime scene and evidence that
              doesn't belong there. <br><img src="outfit.jpg" width= "15%" ><img src="https://st3.depositphotos.com/1000975/18759/i/450/depositphotos_187594776-stock-photo-forensics-investigator-working-in-lab.jpg" width= "33.1%" >
