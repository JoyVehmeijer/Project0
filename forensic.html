              Ever since I was a little girl, I have wanted to become a forensic scientist. It has been my dream for so long and I can't really see myself enjoying anything
              else in my life as much as i would enjoy Forensic Science. Personally, I like to study and job would suit me very well, because
              <ul>
                <li>I love solving puzzle and riddles, the harder the better!</li>
                <li>I love the series of CSI and often figure out who the killer is myself. </li>
                <li>I am a perfectionist and have a great eye for detial.</li>
                <li>I don't find things gross fast. </li>
                <li>I don't get scared easely. </li>
                <li>I work very organized and structured. </li>
              </ul><br>

              Forensic Science is a study where you learn how to collect effidence on a crime scene. When a crime has been committed, forensic scientist come the crime scene and collect fingerprints,
              make pictures of the scene and the evidence and collect traces of DNA. Later, they process everything in the lab to figure out who commited the crime. This has to be done very precize,
              so that the evidence doesn't tampered with and isn't valid anymore. This also clarifies the outfit a forensic scientist wairs at the crime scene. A white suit that covers their whole body,
              a haircap, gloves for the hands and gloves for the shoes and a face mask. All these things make sure no DNA, fingerprints or body fluids gets on the crime scene and evidence that
              doesn't belong there. <br><br><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64010404/80732514-b887d700-8b0c-11ea-9c2e-b2de0aed1e68.jpg" width= "15%" >

              Like I have said a lot, I would absolutely love to study Forensic Science! But there aren't a lot of spots that can be filled with first year students. This year, approximately 650 people have
              signed in at the HvA, the college where I signed in as well. Sadly enougn, there are only 100 spots to be filled, meaning the selection will be very strict! The selection exists of two tests, one
              about your common knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology and math and the other one is about a syllabus containing a case that had already been completed and had all the evidence and information
              about the case. You have to study this case very good and know all the details. Lucky, since not everybody signs in for a date to take the test or shows up to take the test, the competition
              is a little smaller than 650 people. It is expected that, when 650 sign in, around 500/550 people actually take the tests and, by doing so, participate in the selection. This gives me a chance
              of 18-20% of getting accepted, which isn't a lot. I have now been waiting anxiously since februari 10th and should have know april 15th. But, due to the corona virus, two selectiondays couldn't
              take place, causing that date to shift to the beginning of June. So not only do I have to waits 1,5 months more, but the people participating in the selectiondays that are now taking place later
              also have a lot more time learning the content of the tests by heart, giving them a bigger chance getting accepted and me a smaller chance.
