              Ever since I was a little girl, I have wanted to become a forensic scientist. It has been my dream for so long and I can't really see myself enjoying anything <br>
              else in my life as much as i would enjoy Forensic Science. Personally, I like to study and job would suit me very well, because
              <ul>
                <li>I love solving puzzle and riddles, the harder the better!</li>
                <li>I love the series of CSI and often figure out who the killer is myself. </li>
                <li>I am a perfectionist and have a great eye for detial.</li>
                <li>I don't find things gross fast. </li>
                <li>I don't get scared easely. </li>
                <li>I work very organized and structured. </li>
              </ul>
