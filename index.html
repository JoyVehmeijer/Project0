        <p>
          Hello, world! <br> My name is Joy Vehmeijer, I am 17 year old girl from the Netherlands and I just finished High School.
          This means that I now have to choose what my plan is going to be for next year. Am I going to college or am I going to take a gap year?
          There are multiple options I am now choosing between, which are:
          <ol>
            <li> Forensic Science at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. </li>
            <li> A gap year in Salamanca to learn how to speak Spanish fluently. </li>
            <li> Artificial Intellegence at the University van Amsterdam/Computer science and Engineering at TU Delft.</a> </li>
            <li> Industrieel Ontwerpen at TU Delft.</li> <br>
          </ol>
          <p>
          My first choice is Forensic Scienc, no doubt. But there is a chance I don't get accepted to this studie, since there is a heavy selection for this studie.
          Therefore, I knew I had to have a plan B in case I don't get accepted. My plan B was taking a gap year, so that I could live in Salamanca for half a year
          and learn to speak Spanish fluently. But, due to the Corona virus, this isn't a very secure options either. So now I have to come up with a plan C.
          Sadly enough, that is going to be more difficult than I hoped. All the other studies I am initially interested in also have a selection, meaning I am to late to
          register and can't participate in the selection anymore. Only Law doesn't have a selection, but I know barely anythinh about this study. Therefore, I don't know
          whether I would enjoy this study or not. This all means that, if I don't get accepted to Forensic Science, I don't have another solid option yet. Hopefully, after
          doing more research to the other options, that will change. <br>
          After more research, I found that Artificial Intellegence at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam doesn't have selections. I just signed in and that means that, if I
          don't get accepted to Forensic Science, I will probably be studying AI next year.
