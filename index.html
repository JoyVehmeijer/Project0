          Hello, world! My name is Joy Vehmeijer, I am 17 year old girl from the Netherlands and I just finished High School.<br>
          This means that I now have to choose what my plan is going to be for next year. Am I going to college or am I going to take a gap year? <br>
          There are multiple options I am now choosing between, which are: <br>
          <ol>
            <li> Forensic Science at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. </li>
            <li> A gap year in Salamanca to learn how to speak Spanish fluently. </li>
            <li> Artificial Intellegence at the University van Amsterdam/Computer science and Engineering at TU Delft.</a> </li>
            <li> Industrieel Ontwerpen at TU Delft.</li> <br>
          </ol>
          <p>
          My first choice is for sure Forensic Science. But there is a chance I don't get to studie this, since there is a heavy selection for this studie.<br>
          Therefore, I knew I had to have a plan B in case I don't get accepted. My plan B was taking a gap year, so I could live in Salamanca for half a year <br>
          and learn to speak Spanish fluently.
