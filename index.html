          Hello, world! My name is Joy Vehmeijer, I am 17 year old girl from the Netherlands and I just finished High School.
          This means that I now have to choose what my plan is going to be for next year. Am I going to college or am I going to take a gap year? <br>
          There are multiple options I am now choosing between, which are: <br>
          <ol>
            <li> Forensic Science at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. </li>
            <li> A gap year in Salamanca to learn how to speak Spanish fluently. </li>
            <li> Artificial Intellegence at the University van Amsterdam/Computer science and Engineering at TU Delft. </li>
            <li> Industrieel Ontwerpen at TU Delft. </li>
