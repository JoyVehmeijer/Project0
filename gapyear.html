                    <h4> The reason why </h4>
                    Initially, I thought I would study forensic science and if I didn't get accepted I would take a gap year. During this gap year I will live in Salamanca for half a year, so that I would
                    be able to speak Spanish fluently afterwards. The other half year would give me the chance to sign in for Forensic Science for a second time and hopefully get accepted this time
                    and look more into other studies I might be interested in. There were a few other studies that I might enjoy as well, namely Industrial Design (industrieel ontwerpen) and Computer Science
                    and Engineering. But I didn't sign up for these studies this year because the both of them have selections as well and in the Netherlands you are allowed to sign up for only two sttudies with
                    a selection. Therefore, I would have to choose between Industrial Design and Computer Science and Engineering, while I didn't know enougn about those 2 and thus wouldn't be able to know which
                    of the two I would enjoy the most.

                    <h4> Salamanca </h4>
                    In 2018, My family and I slept in Salamanca for a night and explored the sity a bit. I immediately loved it, there are a lot of beautiful old buildings and a huge square with a lot cute restaurants.
                    The vibe is amazing, everywhere you look you see groups of students enjoying themselves, shops selling swords and other Middle Ages stuff and old Roman buildings. All those things make me really want to
                    go and live there for half a year, learn to speak Spanish fluent and maybe follow a few courses. My aunt also lived in Salamanca for a while and she really liked it as well. <br><br>
                    For me, it is quite important to be able to speak a lot of languages. My English is already pretty good, but my Spanish isn't as good as I want it to be. I have already had 7 years of Spanish classes
                    and I still don't really speak it. That is the biggest reason I want to go to Salamanca, since the best way to learn a language is to just speak it and practice it.

                    <h4> Corona Virus</h4>
                    The Corona virus causes a problem. Because of it, it isn't as easy to take a gap year as it would normally be. At this moment, Spain is a dangerous country to go to. Spaniards barely go outside
                    themselves, that is how cautious they are. So, there isn't any certainty that it will be safe in September to go and live there. And, if I am not able to do this in my gap year, taking a gap year
                    wouldn't be as usefull and productive as I want it to be. If this will be the case, I don't want to take a gap year. But that does mean I have to figure out what study I would want to do if I
                    don't get accepted to Forensic Science and that can't be one of the other studies I was maybe interested in since those are deadlines have passed. I now have to find a completely new study that
                    I would enjoy and doesn't have a selection so I can actually do that next year.

                    <h4> The other six months </h4>
                    After the six months I spent in Salamanca, I will come back to the Netherlands speaking fluen Spanish. In the last six months of my gap year, there will be enough time to figure out what other
                    studies might be interesting for me and could be the plan B for upcoming year. My first choice will still be Forensic Science, but I will now have enough time to look more into the other studies
                    containing selections. Or find a study that doesn't have selections, but I do find very interesting! <br><br>
                    Because I will be speaking Spainish very good, I might also do some volunteering or teaching in a Spanish speaking country in, for example, South-America. This way, I will continue speaking and
                    practicing my Spanish and also help those in need. Children, who can't afford going to expensive schools or don't have a good school nearby, still deserve the opportunity to learn. Doing a building
                    project in poor countries is something I am interested in as well. I like I will have a lot of fun doing them and it will also be very rewarding.
