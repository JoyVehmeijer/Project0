                    <h4> The reason why </h4>
                    Initially, I thought I would study forensic science and if I didn't get accepted I would take a gap year. During this gap year I will live in Salamanca for half a year, so that I would
                    be able to speak Spanish fluently afterwards. The other half year would give me the chance to sign in for Forensic Science for a second time and hopefully get accepted this time
                    and look more into other studies I might be interested in. There were a few other studies that I might enjoy as well, namely Industrial Design (industrieel ontwerpen) and Computer Science
                    and Engineering. But I didn't sign up for these studies this year because the both of them have selections as well and in the Netherlands you are allowed to sign up for only two sttudies with
                    a selection. Therefore, I would have to choose between Industrial Design and Computer Science and Engineering, while I didn't know enougn about those 2 and thus wouldn't be able to know which
                    of the two I would enjoy the most.

                    <h4> Corona Virus</h4>
                    The Corona virus causes a problem. Because of it, it isn't as easy to take a gap year as it would normally be. At this moment, Spain is a dangerous country to go to. Spaniards barely go outside
                    themselves, that is how cautious they are. So, there isn't any certainty that it will be safe in September to go and live there. And, if I am not able to do this in my gap year, taking a gap year
                    wouldn't be as usefull and productive as I want it to be. If this will be the case, I don't want to take a gap year. But that does mean I have to figure out what study I would want to do if I
                    don't get accepted to Forensic Science and that can't be one of the other studies I was maybe interested in since those are deadlines have passed. I now have to find a completely new study that
                    I would enjoy and doesn't have a selection so I can actually do that next year.
