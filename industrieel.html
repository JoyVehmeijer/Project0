          Industrial Design is a study in Delft as well and a bit different for all the other studies I mentioned before. Industrial Design is a very creative study.
          In the study, you learn to design utensils, how to solve future problems in a creative and easy usable way and designing your own products. I have a good family friend
          that also studies Industrial Design, so she has told me a little about it already. I went to an open day of the study as well, which I enjoyed a lot. Afterwards however,
          I wasn't convinced if the study suited me enough, since I have never really been a person that is good at painting or drawing. Regardless, I did enjoy the course 'Technic'
          where I could be creative and design all kinds of thing for grades. I am also someone which a creative mind and think outside the box. Nevertheless, just like with Computer Science
          and Engineering, I wasn't sure if I liked this enough as a plan B and therefore didn't enroll. <br> <br>
          But, now that I don't have a lot to do during this corona times, I did really enjoy participating in a design challenge from 'Suspicious Antwerp'. They told there followers on instagram
          to design hoodies for them and they would choose one design and would actually use that one to sell. At first I was a bit hesitant to participate since there wasn't a really big
          chance of me winning and didn't really have experience. Then I thought by myself, why not? I didn't have anything to do and maybe I would even enjoy it. Ang that I really did! I designed
          five hoodies in total and could have designed even more if I had more time. This really showed me that I can and like doing something creative and am quite good at it as well.
          Knowing this, I do regret not applying to Industrial Design, because it would have been something I liked and I would also study in Delft for a year, which I would love a lot.
